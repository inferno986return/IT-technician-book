# IT technician book

A CompTIA/MCSA inspired book with plenty of information for getting your first job in IT. I recommend experimenting and have a practical chapter to familarise yourself with Windows Server.

The goal is to create a book that makes entering the world of IT easier. It's a general guide based off my own real-world experience and is not tied down to a particular certification though I am combining information from the CompTIA trifecta (A+, Network+, Security+), as well as several Microsoft certifications.

I need to look at the *For Dummies* books for inspiration. I'm thinking of using Material icons for infoboxes such as

* A lightbulb icon for tips to keep in mind such as a `ping` request may fail because a network firewall is blocking it, rather than the destination resource being unavailable
* An unlocked padlock icon for insecure technology such as HTTP and WEP.
* A warning triangle for dangerous procedures i.e. flashing BIOS and disassemmbling a PSU.
* A university cap for advanced information.

I can use black boxes with white text for terminal commands.

Start by adapting CompTIA and MCSA notes over on [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/)), diary entries, any information that&#39;s relevant. I can also adapt college assignment material.

Quote: &quot;It takes the smartest individuals to realize there&#39;s always more to learn.&quot;

Quote: &quot;If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants.&quot;

Quote: &quot;Rosa Klebb: Training is useful, but there is no substitute for experience&quot;

Could have an xkcd comic such as this in the preface: https://xkcd.com/627/

Client network outage checklist

**Network outage checklist:**

1. Confirm the situation is a network outage by asking if the issue affects multiple users or just one.

1. Ask users to perform network troubleshooting commands such as ipconfig (or ifconfig) and ping. As well as checking access to shared drives. This may also be a DNS issue, so check which DNS server the computer is using and possibly the hosts file as well.

1. Restart the router by removing power for 10-15 seconds.

1. Escalate to the internet service provider by checking an outage map or calling their support line to request a line test. You may need to check you are a registered contact with the client and have them add you to their account.

Adding RAM and disk storage to Hyper-V and VMware ESX. Using Disk Management and Powershell.

Cover old and new topics. Prioritise new
