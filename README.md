*"It takes the smartest individuals to realize there's always more to learn."*

This is a textbook designed to be a reference to be used for IT 1st-line support analysts. I have included information acquired from studying CompTIA and Microsoft certifications, as well as my own experience working for 2 years in a 1st-line support position at a MSP here in the UK.
